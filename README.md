# SecretSanta

Guidelines
----------
* Use whichever libraries you prefer, or deem suitable for coding/styling purposes. Using libraries linked from public CDNs is preferable (e.g. [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/)).
* The solution will be expected to work via one of the following protocols: http, https.
* Gilt supports all major browsers from IE9 and up. If you have the time to also support these this is a bonus. Please specify which browsers you have aimed to support with your solution.

The Challenge
-------------
* Develop a web UI that loads the contents of users.json and renders a list of random assignments for [Secret Santa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa)
* Extra interactivity/styling will be considered a bonus.
* Use the included index.html and user.json to begin with but do not modify the structure of the users.json. You are free to modify index.html as you wish.


Meabh's Notes
---------------------------
* The code works on opera, chrome, firefox, IE11, IE10
* The js code file is blocked in IE9. I think this is because it is being rendered by 
  a github preview site and MIME type is therefore being obscured
* The code is delivered via HTTP and is stored on github, I'm using a github preview site to display it and run it.
* I used one extra JQuery library and an external image as part of my solution.
* Background image is taken from: http://wallpapers.ae/red-christmas-background-photo.html
* The comments in my javascript file explain my coding approach
